# Sandboxy

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sandboxy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sandboxy) <img src="https://travis-ci.org/jonhue/sandboxy.svg?branch=master" />

Sandboxy allows you to use virtual data-oriented environments inside a Rails application while being able to switch between them at runtime. It achieves that by using a combination of Rack Middleware and ActiveRecord.

## Installation

Sandboxy works with Rails 5.0 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'sandboxy'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sandboxy

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'sandboxy', github: 'jonhue/sandboxy'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g sandboxy

To wrap things up, migrate the changes into your database:

    $ rails db:migrate

## Usage

### Setup

Add Sandboxy to the models where you want to separate records depending on their environments:

```ruby
class Foo < ApplicationRecord
    sandboxy
end
```

In most use cases you would want to add `sandboxy` to a lot of ActiveRecord models if not all. To simplify that you could create a new class and let all your models inherit from it:

```ruby
class SharedSandbox < ApplicationRecord
    sandboxy
end

class Foo < SharedSandbox
end
```

### `sandboxy` methods

By default you can only access records belonging to the current environment (defined by `Sandboxy.environment`):

```ruby
Sandboxy.environment = 'sandbox'
Foo.all # => returns all sandbox foo's
```

Now to access the records belonging to a certain environment regardless of your current environment, you can use:

```ruby
Foo.live_environment # => returns all live foo's
Foo.sandboxed_environment # => returns all sandbox foo's
Foo.desandbox # => returns all foo's
```

Let's check to which environment this `Foo` belongs:

```ruby
foo = Foo.create!
foo.live_environment? # => false
foo.sandbox_environment? # => true
```

You should keep in mind that when you create a new record, it will automatically belong to your app's current environment.

Don't worry, you can move records between environments:

```ruby
foo.move_environment_live
foo.live_environment? # => true
foo.move_environment_sandbox
foo.sandbox_environment? # => true
```

### `Sandboxy` class methods

To access your default environment setting:

```ruby
Sandboxy.configuration.environment # => 'live' / 'sandbox'
Sandboxy.configuration.sandbox_environment? # => true / false
Sandboxy.configuration.live_environment? # => true / false
```

**Note:** `Sandboxy.configuration.environment` does *NOT* return the apps current environment. For that use [`Sandboxy.environment` variable](#switching-environments) instead.

You can also access whether your app retains your environment throughout requests:

```ruby
Sandboxy.configuration.retain_environment # => true / false
```

If `retain_environment` is set to `false` your app will return to your default environment on every new request.

### Switching environments

At runtime you can always switch environments anywhere in your application by setting `Sandboxy.environment`. You can set it to any string you like. That makes Sandboxy super flexible.

```ruby
Sandboxy.environment = 'live'
Sandboxy.live_environment? # => true
Sandboxy.sandboxy_environment? # => true
```

#### Sandbox & APIs

It's flexibility allows Sandboxy to work really well with APIs.

Typically an API provides two sets of authentication credentials for a consumer - one for live access and one for sandbox/testing.

Whenever you authenticate your API's consumer, just make sure to set `Sandboxy.environment` accordingly to the credential the consumer used. From thereon, Sandboxy will make sure that your consumer only reads & updates data from the environment he is in.

## Configuration

You can configure Sandboxy by passing a block to `configure`. This can be done in `config/initializers/sandboxy.rb`:

```ruby
Sandboxy.configure do |config|
    config.environment = 'sandbox'
end
```

**`environment`** Set your environment default. This is the environment that your app boots with. By default it gets refreshed with every new request to your server. Defaults to `'live'`.

**`retain_environment`** Specify whether to retain your current app environment on new requests. If set to `true`, your app will only load your environment default when starting. Every additional switch of your environment at runtime will then not be automatically resolved to your environment default on a new request. Takes a boolean. Defaults to `false`.

## Testing

Tests are written with Shoulda on top of `Test::Unit` with Factory Girl being used instead of fixtures. Tests are run using rake.

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your forked git locally
3. Install dependencies

    `$ bundle install`

4. Run tests

    `$ rake test`

### Test Coverage

Test coverage can be calculated using SimpleCov. Make sure you have the [simplecov gem](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) installed.

1. Uncomment SimpleCov in the Gemfile
2. Uncomment the relevant section in `test/test_helper.rb`
3. Run tests

    `$ rake test`
